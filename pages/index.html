                                      Each of the visualizations linked below have
                                      different MDP simulator and optimization parameters but

                                      When you change the parameters within the visualization the address of the
                                      page will update to save your current parameters. You can
                                      share or save parameter sets by copying and pasting the current address of the
                                      page.

                                      In this version of the visualization we
                                      enable help messages to illustrate the
                                      components. Since no parameters are specified, the
                                      MDP simulator and optimizer determine the initial parameters
                                      when it returns the initialization object. All the
                                      subsequent examples were constructed by changing the
                                      parameters from these initialized values.

                                      Read the help messages and try performing each of the available interactions:
                                      (1) changing the parameters and optimizing the policy, (2) brushing the
                                      histograms, (3) changing the filtered year in the fan charts, (4) brushing the
                                      fan charts, (5) clicking one of the lines in the fan charts to display the
                                      associated rollout's state snapshots, (6) clicking a second set of rollouts
                                      in the history panel to view its comparison.

                                      We would like policies that are optimized to change as the rewards are
                                      changed. This activity explores whether the policies are "interesting."

                                      Look at the coefficients of the current policy and/or the charts for the
                                      policy probabilities. Next change all the reward parameters to
                                      0 and click the "optimize" button. A new policy will be optimized and new
                                      rollouts will return. Look at the updated coefficients and/or the charts
                                      for the policy probabilities. If the policy is sensitive to changing rewards,
                                      the coefficients should change sign or relative magnitude, and the
                                      distribution of policy action should shift. For a more direct
                                      comparison you can press the comparison button for the original policy's
                                      rollouts.

                                      Following our use-case study with MDPvis, we patched numerous issues
                                      with the model. Here we set a flag, "Use Original Bugs," to 1 which
                                      opens a the fixed version of the MDP simulator and optimization algorithm.
                                      We would like to know whether these fixes created a simulator with
                                      significantly different behavior or optimized policies.

                                        All the prior examples use a version of the model with
                                        less spatial resolution to speed exploration. We would like
                                        to know whether the inferences from exploring the domain are
                                        valid at higher resolutions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      <strong>Recommended interaction:</strong> Validate different model fidelities
                                      by changing the "Landscape Size" parameter and generating rollouts. Compare
                                      each of the resulting rollouts to each other. Ideally the percentiles
                                      of each fidelity will be equal and show a straight line across the fan charts.
                                    </p>
